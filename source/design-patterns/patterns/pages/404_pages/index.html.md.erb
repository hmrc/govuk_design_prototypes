404 pages (usually described as a 'page not found error') tell users that the page they were trying to access is not there.

Processes and systems should be put in place to prevent users encountering 404 pages in the first place.

## Why users see 404 pages

There are two main reasons users encounter a 404 page:

1. we [HMRC] made a mistake, for example, they followed a link (URL) that is broken or pointing to the wrong location
2. the user made a mistake, for example, they typed or copied a link incorrectly

## How 404 pages should be designed
As with all error messages, we should reassure users that their work or progress is safe and then help them to fix the error.

### 404 pages where we made a mistake
There are a few possible reasons why this may happen 
- if a user clicked a broken link
- if a user bookmarked a page and the page has been moved or removed

#### Broken links
Unit tests should catch errors like this but because of the often disjointed nature of the services we build 100% coverage may not always be possible.

If a user has clicked a broken link, we will - in most cases - know this because the referring URL of the page will be from within a GOV.UK domain or other domain that we control. 404 errors should be logged and fixed as soon as possible.

In this situation, we can tell users that we are aware of the problem and are working to resolve it. 

**Example 404 page telling users that we know about the problem.**

If the result of a broken link is that a user can not complete the transaction and if the service they are using has an alternative channel that they can use. Users should be signposted to this channel to complete their transaction.

Example: 404 page with an alternative route.


#### Bookmarked pages
Whenever a page is moved or removed, a 301 redirect should be implemented to ensure that bookmarks or external links are handled in a friendly way.

If a 301 redirect has not or can not be implemented users will be shown a 404 page. In this case, we would not know the referring URL so we can determine that this has been linked to from an external source, outside of our control. 
In this case, the same 404 page should be used as if the user has made a mistake described below.

### 404 pages where the user made a mistake
There are a few possible reasons this may happen
- if a user copied a link by selecting the link text - on a web page or other digital medium
- if a user physically copied a link by looking at the link - from a piece of paper either printed or written down - and retyping it

#### Copied links
When users copy links - either by copying and pasting or retyping a link - there is a high chance of them making an error that they do not notice. In this situation, the content of the 404 page should help them to self-diagnose the issue and fix it.

We can help the user to
- check the link is correct
- look out for spaces or other irregularities in the link
- search for the page that they were trying to access if the page is something that they can search for, such as a start page
- get help with the problem if the link is likely to be from official correspondence from HMRC such as a printed letter by providing an alternative channel if one exists

Example: 404 page when the user has made a mistake

Example: 404 page when the user has made a mistake, and there is an alternative channel that they can use

In the situation where a single user continually makes the same error either through copying and pasting or typing the link incorrectly. We can intercept these repeated attempts and provide more detailed help such as providing an alternative channel if one is available. In this situation, we may want to withhold this option initially so that users can self-help through a digital channel rather than diverting them to less efficient channels.
