A shutter page is a page that is shown when a service has been switched off on purpose. These are different to page not found and technical difficulties pages.

Wherever possible, a shutter page should include:

* the day, date and time the service is going to be back
* other ways for someone to do what they need to do, if there are any
    
Have a general page that does not include the day, date and time so a service can be shuttered quickly, before the content can be updated. But update the content as fast as possible.

The page should:

* have “Service unavailable” as the page title and H1
* include the service title to reassure people they are in the right service
* be clear and concise
* not have alpha or beta banners
* not have breadcrumbs
* not use vague terms like maintenance or jargon like private beta
* not use red text to warn people

## General page

This is a placeholder that can be used quickly if there is no time to change the content.

### Example 1
A service that has a contact page on GOV UK

A service that has a contact number, but no contact page

### Example 3
A service that has no offline support

## Day, date and time

This includes the helpful day, date and time information when a service will be available.

### Example 1

## End of reporting period

This is for a service, like tax credit renewals, that is only open for part of the year.

### Example 1
A service that has a contact page on GOV UK
![Example of a Tax credits shutter page](tc-closed.png)

### Example 2
A service that has a contact number, but no contact page

### Example 3
A service that has no offline support

## Closed forever

You should try and provide information about what has replaced it or what people need to do if they have outstanding questions.

### Example 1
A service that has a contact page on GOV UK
![Example of a Tax credits shutter page](tc-permanent.png)

### Example 2
A service that has a contact number, but no contact page
![Example of a Tax credits shutter page](ei-permanent.png)

### Example 3
A service that has no offline support

## Not available yet

This is for a service that has not opened yet. This could be for tax credit renewals, which opens in April, or for a service that has been published but is not open until a specific day. These pages may be the same as the day, date and time pages.

### Example 1
A service that has a contact page on GOV UK

### Example 2
A service that has a contact number, but no contact page
